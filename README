3. Results of profiling
-----------------------

Profiling results gathered from 3 individual 3 minute runs, total 3274 sending
state-change events and 465 receiving state-change events.

Time from receiving data (socket) to visualizing in milliseconds:
 min/avg/max/stddev: 1/6.0/44/4.9

Time from touching event to sending network message in milliseconds:
 min/avg/max/stddev: 1/3.0/34/1.5

Memory allocations between two receiving data events:
 Number of new allocations (avg): 37
 Used new memory in bytes (avg): 1395

Memory allocations between two sending data events:
 Number of new allocations (avg): 34
 Used new memory in bytes (avg): 1127
