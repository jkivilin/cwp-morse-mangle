This project was part of "Embedded Software Development Environments" course in
spring 2012 (University of Oulu, Faculty of Science, Department of Information
Processing Science). Goal was to develop an application for transmitting and
receiving signals using Continuous Wave Protocol (protocol designed only for
use by this course).

Protocol specification is available at http://cwp.opimobi.com/
